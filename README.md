# Disease Outbreak Prediction

This project uses Machine Learning to predict whether a person is likely to have **Diabetes**, **Heart Disease**, or **Parkinsonâ€™s Disease** based on input medical parameters. It aims to provide early warnings and aid in healthcare decision-making.

##  Project Overview

The goal of this application is to demonstrate how machine learning models can assist in predicting potential diseases using historical data and user-provided health metrics.

###  Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **Pandas**, **NumPy**, **Scikit-learn**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript** (for frontend)
- **Streamlit** (for basic deployment)

---

##  ML Models Used

- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Each disease has its own dataset and model trained individually to maximize accuracy and performance.
